## Intuition

There are countless people who planned their retirement by saving a monthly sum and investing it into the stock market ğŸ“ˆğŸ“ˆğŸ“ˆ.

There are also plenty of investment gurus advocating this investment strategy that is known as "Passive Investment", which means you do not try to time the market, but rather you invest periodically no matter the current level of market.
