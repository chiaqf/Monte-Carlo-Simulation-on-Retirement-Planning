# A Monte Carlo Simulation of your Retirement Planning ğŸ’µğŸ’µ
## Intuition

There are countless people who planned their retirement by saving a monthly sum and investing it into the stock market ğŸ“ˆğŸ“ˆğŸ“ˆ.

There are also plenty of investment gurus advocating this investment strategy that is known as "Passive Investment", which means you do not try to time the market, but rather you invest periodically no matter the current level of market.

I prepare my future nest egg ğŸ¥šğŸ¥š this way too, as an engineer who won't be convinced without seeing the data, I am going to do some research on the practicality of this approach by using Monte Carlo Simulation.
